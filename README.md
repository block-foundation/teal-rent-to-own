## Introduction


## Quick Start

## Contract

The contract assumes a rental amount and total payments needed for ownership. It only allows the tenant to make payments, which must be the exact amount of the rent. Each payment is counted and stored in the global and local state of the contract. If the payment count reaches the total needed for ownership, the contract will mark the property as owned.

It's important to note that this contract is quite simplified compared to the Solidity version. Due to the differences in contract structure between Ethereum and Algorand, not all the functionality of the Solidity contract can be replicated in PyTeal. In particular, handling overpayments or adjusting the rental amount would need to be handled off-chain. Additionally, for more complex functionalities and interactions with other contracts, Algorand offers Atomic Transfers and Algorand Standard Assets (ASAs).

As with the Solidity version, this is a basic model and doesn't cover all possible edge cases or legal requirements. It's recommended to consult with a legal and financial advisor when creating real-world contracts.
